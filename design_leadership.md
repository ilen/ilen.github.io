        <h2 id="content">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>In 2014 Enphase Energy announced a residential battery that would integrate with its solar offering. While this represented a relatively small market, it required a complete re-thinking of the existing monitoring application. </p>

		      <h3>My Role</h3>
               <p>In addition to leading the PM, UX and design teams in converting an R&amp;D concept to shippable product, I was responsible for:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Initial app concept development and competitive analysis </li>
                   <li>Defining the user research approach, especially focus groups and surveys </li>
                   <li>Managing the iterative realization of the application in alignment with the overall hardware  launch </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Key Questions</h3>
                <p> Adding storage moves users from passive observation of their systems to active monitoring and tuning. As we moved past initial concepting the following key questions emerged:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How do we manage customer expectations of real-time interaction?</li>
                    <li>How can we help users understand flow of energy within the home?</li>
                    <li>How can we seamlessly integrate a home-based view into the existing solar-oriented application?</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Managing customer expectations</h4>
                <p> Customers expected real time energy data that could not be delivered by the physical system. To address this, data recency was incorporated on the status banner and I directed the team to focus  the interaction design on creating a highly dynamic view of historical data.</p>
